## Works in Progress

1. ### Getting in all the Cracks: Monetary Policy, Financial Vulnerabilities, and Macro Risk

   Coauthored with Andrea Ajello
   
   Abstract: We estimate the effect of monetary policy on financial vulnerabilities and the implications for macroeconomic tail risk. We first extract a small set of common factors from a large dataset of financial vulnerability indicators, estimating a factor-augmented proxy SVAR to study the response of aggregate economic activity, inflation, and financial vulnerabilities to monetary policy shocks. We then estimate the effect of changes in the financial vulnerability factors on macroeconomic tail risk via quantile regressions. We find that an unexpected monetary policy tightening can lower asset valuation vulnerabilities in the short term and slow down credit growth in the medium term. As tighter monetary policy reduces asset valuation pressures, it does so at a cost of a sizable increase in macro tail risk in the short term that is only partially offset by a modest reduction in tail risk in the medium term, induced by a slowdown in credit growth.

2. ### Estimation and Inference of Impulse Responses With Random Forests

   Coauthored with Francisco Vazquez-Grande
   
   Abstract: This paper introduces methods to estimate and conduct inference on impulse responses without specification and estimation of the underlying system, which are particularly suited in the presence of a nonlinear structure.  We use flexible machine learning techniques to estimate response values at each horizon of interest, as it is done with local projections. The advantages of our tree-based method over traditional available methods to estimate impulse responses are the following: (1) they automatically estimate nonlinear specifications without having to postulate a specific nonlinear model; (2) they allow for the inclusion of a large number of covariates that far exceed the limits of linear models; (3) they are more robust to model misspecification; (4) they can estimate asymmetric impulses based on the sign and magnitude of a shock. We present Monte Carlo evidence and applications to a simple models that make these advantages apparent.

3. ### Bank Credit Supply Shocks and Economic Activity: The Role of Lending Standards

   Coauthored with Elijah Broadbent and Horacio Sapriza
   
   Abstract: We construct bank credit supply indicators for the four major loan categories in the United States using changes in lending standards from bank-level responses to the Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, adjusted for macroeconomic and bank-specific factors that affect loan demand. We evaluate the ability of these indicators to predict economic activity and estimate the effect of unit shocks to these indicators on economic activity and monetary policy rates.  First, we find that credit supply indicators for business loans generally provide more out-of-sample predictive information for economic activity than the indicators for household loans. Second, we find that negative shocks to the credit supply indicators decrease economic activity and monetary policy rates, particularly when applied to the commercial and industrial lending category. Third, we find that the magnitude of these effects strongly depends on the stance of monetary policy and broad financial conditions, whereas a negative shock leads to monetary policy easing and declines in economic activity when either financing conditions or the monetary policy stance are tight, but has little impact otherwise.
