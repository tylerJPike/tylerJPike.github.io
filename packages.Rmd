   This package creates a paradigm to provide a structured and automated approach to out-of-sample time series forecasting, a common, important, and subtle task. In many ways, this package is merely a wrapper for the excellent exant time series forecasting routines on CRAN -- including both traditional econometric time series models and modern machine learning techniques. However, this package additionally provides a modern and comprehensive set of forecast combination tools and forecast comparison metrics.

   This package produces and plots tree-based impulse response functions. Users may choose from two random forest variants, implement instrumental variable, allow state-dependence, and choose lags based on information criteria or forecasting accuracy.
